# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
I will be learning about data modeling, engineering, and analysis. With my knowledge of DataFrames and tabular data, I will be:
  - Designing an entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) that will apply to the data.
  - Create and use a SQL database.
  - Importing and exporting large CSV datasets into pgAdmin.
  - Practice using different joins to create new tables in pgAdmin.
  - Writing basic to intermediate level SQL statements.

## Resources
- Data Source: departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv
- Software: SQL, QuickDBD, pgAdmin 4, PostgresSQL

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, I will use advanced queries and joins to create a list of candidates for the mentorship program. To create the new list of potential mentors, I will need to create a query that returns a list of current employees eligible for retirement, as well as their most recent titles. To get the final list with the recent titles, I’ll also need to partition the data so that each employee is only included on the list once. In addition, Iu’ll need to perform a query that shows how many current employees of each title are presently eligible for retirement. The final query should return the potential mentor’s employee number, first and last name, their title, birth date and employment dates.

The goals for this challenge are:
  1. Use an ERD to undestand relationships between SQL tables.
  2. Create new tables in pgAdmin by using different joins.
  3. Write basic to intermediate level SQL statements.
  4. Export new tables to a CSV file.
